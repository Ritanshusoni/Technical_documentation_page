                <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with
                    first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
                    non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. </p>

            <article>
                <p>JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Internal JS:</strong> "We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the
                        code inside the script tag. The "script" tag can either be placed inside the "head" or the
                        "body" tag according to the requirement." </li>
                    <li><strong>External JS:</strong> We can write JavaScript code in other file having an extension .js
                        and then link this file inside the "head" tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this
                        code.</li>

            <article>
                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your
                first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                greetMe("World");
              </code>

                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
                browser!

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
                names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because
                JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through
                "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
                You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
                identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
                _name.

            <article>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
                    can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
                    always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                    warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
                    can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                    below.
                </p>
            </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                    global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                    current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
                    called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                    function.
                </p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                    rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
                    global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                    code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
                    context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
                    is an if statement.
                </p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                    ECMAScript 2015.
                </p>

                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                defined</code>
            </article>

        <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
            <header>Global variables</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                    pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                    variables using the window.variable syntax.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
                    frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
                    name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
                    document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                    parent.phoneNumber.

            <header>Constants</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
                    syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                    identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
                    can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                </p>

                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                    while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
                    variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
                    represent a variable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                    variable in the same scope. For example:
                </p>

                <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                }</code>
                However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
                is executed without problems.
                <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
            <header>Data types</header>
            <article>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                            <li>
                                null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                                is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
                                other variant.
                            </li>
                            <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                            <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                            <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                            <li>
                                Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                                unique and immutable.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
                to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
                are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
                objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
                your application can perform.

        <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
            <header>if...else statement</header>
            <article>
                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
                true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the condition
                is false. An if statement looks as follows:

                <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
                condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
                including further nested if statements.
                <p>
                    You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                    conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>
                <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) { statement_2;
                } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else { statement_last; }
              </code>
                In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which
                evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple statements, group
                them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general, it's good practice
                to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

                <code>if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code>
                It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression,
                because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over
                the code. For example, do not use the following code:
                <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> If you need to use an
                assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

                <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
            <header>while statement</header>
            <article>
                A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition
                evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:

                <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes false,
                statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                statement following the loop.

                <p>
                    The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
                    the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
                    tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
                    control is passed to the statement following while.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group
                    those statements.
                </p>

                Example:

                <p>The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:</p>

                <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
                <p>
                    With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                    Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                    <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                    true, so the loop terminates.

            <article>
                A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
                statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function.</li>
                    <li>
                        A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                        separated by commas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
                        brackets, { }.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
                </p>

                <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                <p>
                    The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
                    consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
                    function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
                    specifies the value returned by the function.
                </p>
                <code>return number * number;</code>
                <p>
                    Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
                    value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
                    the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
                    the calling function.

            <header>What can be build using JS</header>
            <article>
                <p>JavaScript is a widely-used programming language. Given below are some domains/products that can be
                    built using JavaScript:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Websites: </strong>JavaScript helps us to add behavior of our website. It helps users to
                        interact with the website. For eg. clicking on buttons, saving details, uploading details on the
                        website, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web servers: </strong> We can make robust server applications using JavaScript. To be
                        precise we use JavaScript frameworks like Node.js and Express.js to build these servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Game Development: </strong> In Game Development industry, JavaScript is used widely.
                        With the addition of HTML5 Canvas, it’s now possible to make 2D and 3D games in JavaScript very
                        efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>3D Drawings: </strong>JavaScript in addition with HTML Canvas is used to make
                        three-dimensional graphics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile Apps: </strong>Mobile applications are the most popular modes of communicating
                        these days. JavaScript also used to design mobile applications. There are many JavaScript
                        frameworks using which we can make android, IOS, and hybrid apps.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smartwatch Apps: </strong>The popular smartwatch maker Pebble has created Pebble.js, a
                        small JavaScript framework that allows a developer to create an application for the Pebble line
                        of watches in JavaScript.</li>

            <header>Why to learn JavaScript ?</header>
            <article>
                <p>JavaScript is the most popular and hence the most loved language around the globe. Apart from this,
                    there are abundant reasons to learn it. Below are a listing of few important points:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No need of compilers:</strong> Since JavaScript is an interpreted language, therefore it
                        does not need any compiler for compilations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Used both Client and Server-side:</strong>Earlier JavaScript was used to build
                        client-side applications only, but with the evolution of its frameworks namely Node.js and
                        Express.js, it is now widely used for building server-side applications too.</li>
                    <li><strong>Helps to build a complete solution:</strong>As we saw, JavaScript is widely used in both
                        client and server-side applications, therefore it helps us to build an end-to-end solution to a
                        given problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Used everywhere: </strong>JavaScript is so loved because it can be used anywhere. It can
                        be used to develop websites, games or mobile apps, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Huge community support:</strong>JavaScript has a huge community of users and mentors who
                        love this language and take it’s legacy forward.</li>
