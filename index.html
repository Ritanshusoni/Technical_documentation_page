                <p>JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with
                    first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
                    non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript
                    is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
                    imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more about JavaScript.</p>
                <p>The standards for JavaScript are the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262) and the ECMAScript
                    Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402). The JavaScript documentation throughout MDN is
                    based on the latest draft versions of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402. And in cases where some proposals for
                    new ECMAScript features have already been implemented in browsers, documentation and examples in MDN
                    articles may use some of those new features.</p>
                <p>Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are
                    trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two
                    programming languages have very different syntax, semantics, and use.</p>

                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on

                <p>JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Internal JS:</strong> "We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the
                        code inside the script tag. The "script" tag can either be placed inside the "head" or the
                        "body" tag according to the requirement." </li>
                    <li><strong>External JS:</strong> We can write JavaScript code in other file having an extension .js
                        and then link this file inside the "head" tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this
                        code.</li>

            <article>
                <p>JavaScript is a widely-used programming language. Given below are some domains/products that can be
                    built using JavaScript:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Websites: </strong>JavaScript helps us to add behavior of our website. It helps users to
                        interact with the website. For eg. clicking on buttons, saving details, uploading details on the
                        website, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Web servers: </strong> We can make robust server applications using JavaScript. To be
                        precise we use JavaScript frameworks like Node.js and Express.js to build these servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Game Development: </strong> In Game Development industry, JavaScript is used widely.
                        With the addition of HTML5 Canvas, it’s now possible to make 2D and 3D games in JavaScript very
                        efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>3D Drawings: </strong>JavaScript in addition with HTML Canvas is used to make
                        three-dimensional graphics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile Apps: </strong>Mobile applications are the most popular modes of communicating
                        these days. JavaScript also used to design mobile applications. There are many JavaScript
                        frameworks using which we can make android, IOS, and hybrid apps.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smartwatch Apps: </strong>The popular smartwatch maker Pebble has created Pebble.js, a
                        small JavaScript framework that allows a developer to create an application for the Pebble line
                        of watches in JavaScript.</li>

            <header>Why to learn JavaScript ?</header>
            <article>
                <p>JavaScript is the most popular and hence the most loved language around the globe. Apart from this,
                    there are abundant reasons to learn it. Below are a listing of few important points:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No need of compilers:</strong> Since JavaScript is an interpreted language, therefore it
                        does not need any compiler for compilations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Used both Client and Server-side:</strong>Earlier JavaScript was used to build
                        client-side applications only, but with the evolution of its frameworks namely Node.js and
                        Express.js, it is now widely used for building server-side applications too.</li>
                    <li><strong>Helps to build a complete solution:</strong>As we saw, JavaScript is widely used in both
                        client and server-side applications, therefore it helps us to build an end-to-end solution to a
                        given problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Used everywhere: </strong>JavaScript is so loved because it can be used anywhere. It can
                        be used to develop websites, games or mobile apps, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Huge community support:</strong>JavaScript has a huge community of users and mentors who
                        love this language and take it’s legacy forward.</li>
                </ul>
